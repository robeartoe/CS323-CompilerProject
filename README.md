# Resources For Class:
1. [Building a Simple Interpreter in Python](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)
  * This article talks about tokens and lexical analyzers and all that. Can be definitely used as a stepping stone for our project.
2. [Scanning and Creating Tokens (Implmented with Java)](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html)
  * The Concept is the same, but this is a really good example, in fact, this whole book is really good, for the entire project.
3. [RE C++ CheatSheet](http://cpprocks.com/files/c++11-regex-cheatsheet.pdf)
